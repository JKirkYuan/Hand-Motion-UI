# Raidal Menu with LeapMotion

This is the repo where I will use the HoverUI kit to create a navigable Radial Menu
for VR, I created my own version that can be used for Desktop Users. :tada: :tada:

```bash

# Installation
INSTALL UNITY 5.5! This is the only version I have tested.

# Cloning and setup
git clone https://github.com/JKirkYuan/Hand-Motion-UI.git

# Find and Load the Scenes
In Unity open the folder that you cloned and
go into Assets > LeapMotion > Scenes > Play_Disk <-- Open this Unity File


```

### Issues
Currently Leap Motion Orion is in Beta and does not work with MacOS !!
